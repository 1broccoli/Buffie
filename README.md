🧠 Core Features

Custom Duration Formats: Choose how you see your buffs — seconds only, min/sec, mm:ss — you name it.

Font & Icon Tweaks: Crank up the font size, scale icons, or tweak transparency. Make it pop or keep it sleek.

Color-Changing Timers: Buffs flash with urgency as they near expiration. You’ll never miss that last-second reapply again.

Freedom of Layout: Customize spacing, buffs per row, and max rows. Drag, drop, and lock the whole frame where you want.

Easy GUI: Use /bds or /buffduration for a slick, responsive config window. Sliders, pickers, and previews included.

Instant Reset Options: Go back to defaults or revert to Blizzard’s stock UI anytime.

🎯 Why Buffie?

Battle-Ready Visibility: Clean, readable timers with color alerts keep your focus sharp.

Your UI, Your Rules: No more cookie-cutter layouts. Buffy bends to your will.

On-the-Fly Edits: Make changes mid-fight, no reloads, no fuss.

Total Control: Unlock and move your buffs with precision. Lock them down once you’ve claimed your space.
